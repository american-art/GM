His artistic talent, which manifested itself early, was first directed to the drawing of animals, and at least twice in his younger days he joined a traveling circus, presumably for the opportunity it would give him the observe animal life at close range. In 1853, when he was sicteen, he went to France for two years' study with Rosa Bonheur, from whom it is said he won high commendation.

His artistic talent, which manifested itself early, was first directed to the drawing of animals, and at least twice in his younger days he joined a traveling circus, presumably for the opportunity it would give him the observe animal life at close range. In 1853, when he was sicteen, he went to France for two years' study with Rosa Bonheur, from whom it is said he won high commendation. 
     Upon his return he traveled for three of four years with a circus, making many sketches of Indian life along the highways. In 1860 he moved to Chicago with his family and lost no time in visiting the Indian country of the midwest. He was in Minnesota in 1862, the year of the Sioux Outbreak, and make sketches of most of the participants, some before and some after the uprising. After a brief season in the East, during which he painted and decorated for P.T. Barnum the wagons he was assembling for his circus and menagerie, Cross agian headed for the west. 
      For many years he spent much of his time with the frontiersmen and Indians of the West and Southwest. He became intimately acquainted with Buffalo Bill and other scouts and guides, learned the Siouc tongew and the India sign language, and made a careful studey of the characteristics of various tribes he lived among. 
     His portraits and animal pictures were all made from life, and his reputation rests largely on the remarkable liknesses he achieved and the great fidelity with which he protrayed the characteristic features of the Indina dress and habitat. ""His Indians,"" wrote Buffalo Bill Cody, ""are not the tobacco sigen variety, but having been sketched from life by the greatest painter of Indian portraiture of all times, they are genuine, having the wild, stolid characteristics of the real Indian/ Having an acquaintance wth many of the indians and scouts sketched by Mr. Cross, I do not hesitate to pronouce his portraits not only good but striking likenesses.""
      Ultimately they came to the attention of Thomas B. Walker, who gave Cross commissions that occupied much of his time in the decade preceding his death in 1918.""

Early Life
Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and grew up on the east side.  In his autobiographical book, he describes growing up on the outskirts of Tulsa and getting into significant trouble with drugs and women.  His early life would greatly influence his later art.  

Education

Publications

Influences
Andoe on first becoming interested in art: ""I saw that there were guys [such as] Robert Smitson, Dennis Oppenheim  guys who wore cowboy boots, guys who looked like me  doing this stuff. I didn't really understand what they were doing, but they kind of looked like construction workers, like me and my friends, and they were doing this and it looked like they were havin' fun.""

Born January 12, 1837, at Bolton Lancashire (England) accompanied his family to Maryland in 1844, and studied painting with his brother Edward in Philadelphia during the mid-1850. In 1862 the two Morans' went to England for further study and came under the influence of Turner. Thomas visited Europe again in the same decade and several times in the later years. His fame rests largely on his large paintings of scenes in the Far West, including Yellowstone Park, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. His home was in Philadelphia until 1872 when he moved to Newark (N.J.) and shortly after to NYC. In 1916 he moved to Santa Barbara (Cal.) where he died on August 26, 1926.""",,1837,1926,1837-1926,American,http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=moran&role=&nation=&prev_page=1&subjectid=500015257,1,500015257,male,Artist

9006,"Moran, Thomas",Thomas Moran,Thomas,,Moran,,,"""Thomas Moran, landscape painter, etcher, engraver, lithographer. Born January 12, 1837, at Bolton Lancashire (England) accompanied his family to Maryland in 1844, and studied painting with his brother Edward in Philadelphia during the mid-1850. In 1862 the two Morans' went to England for further study and came under the influence of Turner. Thomas visited Europe again in the same decade and several times in the later years. His fame rests largely on his large paintings of scenes in the Far West, including Yellowstone Park, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. His home was in Philadelphia until 1872 when he moved to Newark (N.J.) and shortly after to NYC. In 1916 he moved to Santa Barbara (Cal.) where he died on August 26, 1926.""",,1837,1926,1837-1926,American,http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=moran&role=&nation=&prev_page=1&subjectid=500015257,2,500015257,male,Original Artist

His artistic talent, which manifested itself early, was first directed to the drawing of animals, and at least twice in his younger days he joined a traveling circus, presumably for the opportunity it would give him the observe animal life at close range. In 1853, when he was sicteen, he went to France for two years' study with Rosa Bonheur, from whom it is said he won high commendation. 
     Upon his return he traveled for three of four years with a circus, making many sketches of Indian life along the highways. In 1860 he moved to Chicago with his family and lost no time in visiting the Indian country of the midwest. He was in Minnesota in 1862, the year of the Sioux Outbreak, and make sketches of most of the participants, some before and some after the uprising. After a brief season in the East, during which he painted and decorated for P.T. Barnum the wagons he was assembling for his circus and menagerie, Cross agian headed for the west. 
      For many years he spent much of his time with the frontiersmen and Indians of the West and Southwest. He became intimately acquainted with Buffalo Bill and other scouts and guides, learned the Siouc tongew and the India sign language, and made a careful studey of the characteristics of various tribes he lived among. 
     His portraits and animal pictures were all made from life, and his reputation rests largely on the remarkable liknesses he achieved and the great fidelity with which he protrayed the characteristic features of the Indina dress and habitat. ""His Indians,"" wrote Buffalo Bill Cody, ""are not the tobacco sigen variety, but having been sketched from life by the greatest painter of Indian portraiture of all times, they are genuine, having the wild, stolid characteristics of the real Indian/ Having an acquaintance wth many of the indians and scouts sketched by Mr. Cross, I do not hesitate to pronouce his portraits not only good but striking likenesses.""
